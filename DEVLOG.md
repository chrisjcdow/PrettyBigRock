# FynbosOS development log

FynbosOS is developed by Chris together with Claude, Anthropic's AI model.
This log records what was built in each session and who did what.

## Session 1: 28 October 2026, from one prompt to a booting desktop

**The prompt (Chris):** "Could you write me an operating system that I could boot in a VM.
This OS should have a GUI. Try not to plagiarise too much."

**What Claude built, in about 24 minutes:**
- A two-stage boot loader that picks a VESA graphics mode and enters 32-bit protected mode
- A kernel with interrupts, timer, PS/2 keyboard and mouse, CMOS clock and ACPI power-off
- Double-buffered graphics, a hand-drawn 5x9 font, pixel-art icons and a mouse cursor
- A window manager with draggable windows, taskbar, start menu and desktop icons
- A procedurally drawn wallpaper of Table Mountain at sunset, tablecloth included
- Seven apps: Terminal, Notepad, Files, Calculator, Paint, Snake and About
- Disk images for QEMU, VirtualBox and VMware

Claude tested it in QEMU by scripting mouse and keyboard input and reading screenshots,
fixing a few things along the way (a hidden sun, a spiky cloud, Ctrl+Esc, scrollback).

**Chris:** booted it on Harriet (Windows 11 laptop) in QEMU, and decided to publish it on GitHub
and keep developing it together.
